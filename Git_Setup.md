## Ensure Git is added to your System's PATH 
  - If Git is not recognized in your terminal, you need to add it to your System's PATH.

  - On `Windows`:
    - Search for `Edit the System's Environment Variables` in the `Start Menu`.
    - Under `Advanced`, click `Environment Variables`.
    - Under `User Variables`, click on the `PATH` variable, then click `Edit`.
    - Click `New` and Add the path to your `Git bin` folder (e.g., C:\Program Files\Git\bin\git.exe).
    - `Click OK` to Save.
