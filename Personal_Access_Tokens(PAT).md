## What is a Personal-Access-Token or (PAT)?
  - A `Personal Access Token (PAT)` is a String of Characters (a type of API Token) that serves as an Authentication Method for accessing APIs or performing tasks on platforms like `GitHub`, `GitLab`, or other Version Control Systems.
  - It is used as a `Replacement for Passwords`, especially in contexts where `Automated or Programmatic Access` is needed.
  - `GitHub introduced Personal-Access-Tokens (PATs) on August 12, 2013`, as part of their API Authentication Mechanism.
  - Over time, they `Replaced Password-Based Authentication` for Git operations to enhance Security, with `Passwords Officially Deprecated for API use on August 13, 2021`.
  <br>
  
  - **Features:**
    - **`API Authentication:`** PATs allow developers to access a platform's API Programmatically.
    - **`Git Operations:`** Used to Authenticate Git Operations (e.g. git clone, git push, git pull) instead of passwords.
    - **`Tool Access:`** Enables External Tools (e.g., GitHub CLI, GitHub Desktop) to Authenticate Securely.
    - **`Scoped Access:`** Provides Control over which Resources can be Accessed.
  <br>
  
  - **Advantages Over Password-Authentication:**
    - **`Enhanced Security:`** **PATs are Specific to Certain Tasks and cannot be used to Log In to the Web Interface**, reducing the Risk of Full Account Compromise. They can be Encrypted and Stored Securely, Avoiding Exposure of Actual Passwords.
    - **`Fine-Grained Permissions:`** **PATs allow you to grant only the Necessary Permissions, such as Read-Only or Specific Repository Access**, unlike Passwords which provide Full Access.
    - **`Scoped Usage:`** **You can Limit PATs to Specific Actions**, such as accessing APIs, workflows, or repository management, while passwords have no such scoping capabilities.
    - **`Expiration and Control:`** **PATs can be Configured to Expire automatically after a Set Period**, improving Security by Limiting their Validity.
    - **`Ease of Revocation:`** **Individual PATs can be Revoked without affecting your Main Account or Other Access Methods.** Changing a Password disrupts all Tools and Sessions using it.

    <br>
  - Inside Developer Settings, Click on `Personal Access Tokens` >> Select `Tokens (classic)` >> Click on `Generate new token (classic)`.<br>
    ![GitHub_Settings>>Developer Settings >> Generate Token](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09e38ff2-b223-4e78-a786-2a6a58f6982b)
    <br>
  - Enter an apporpriate `Token Name`. Replace **'Demo_Token'** with your **'Desired-Token_Name'**<br>
    ![Generate Token>>Enter Token Name](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b35e45f6-bcab-4f22-b45c-5d220c374e75)
    <br>
  - Set `Expiration`.<br>
    ![Generate Token>>Expiration](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21827c5f-a5cb-4446-80a2-8f04ccfdec06)
    <br>
    `Note:` You can also implement `Custom Expiration` for better Security and Control.<br>

    <br>
  - Under `Select Scopes` choose the permissions you want to grant to the token.<br>
    ![Generate Token>>Select Scopes_1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ae20ab8-1709-4f47-9df3-afad2eef295c)
    <br>
    ![Generate Token>>Select Scopes_2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aec8d8ca-a996-4b26-bc3f-46d9eca3800e)
    <br>
    **Here are some `General Scopes` commonly selected for a PAT to Enhance Efficiency:**
    - `repo`
    - `workflow`
    - `write:packages`
    - **`Alert:` Any Scopes other than the three mentioned above are not recommended for General Use Tokens or Public-Access Tokens.**
    - **`Note:`If you are the Administrator then you can enable the Scopes mentioned in the Image above for General Administrative Efficiency.**
    <br>
  - Click on `Generate Token` at the bottom of the page to Create your Personal-Access-Token.<br>
    ![Generate Token>>Click on Generate_Token](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/491d6f18-68cb-4171-8f94-016f43f77b93)
    <br>
  - **Congratulations! Your Personal-Access-Token has been successfully generated!!**<br>
    ![Copy the Personal-Access-Token](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/98324cb9-9ef6-4aa9-b4e2-153bfad9c805)
    <br>
    `Alert!:` Make sure to Copy and Securely save your Personal-Access-Token now, as you wonâ€™t be able to View it Again!
