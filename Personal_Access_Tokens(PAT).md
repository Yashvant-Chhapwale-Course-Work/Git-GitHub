## What is a Personal-Access-Token or (PAT)?
  - A `Personal Access Token (PAT)` is a String of Characters (a type of API Token) that serves as an Authentication Method for accessing APIs or performing tasks on platforms like `GitHub`, `GitLab`, or other Version Control Systems.
  - It is used as a `Replacement for Passwords`, especially in contexts where `Automated or Programmatic Access` is needed.
  - `GitHub introduced Personal-Access-Tokens (PATs) on August 12, 2013`, as part of their API Authentication Mechanism.
  - Over time, they `Replaced Password-Based Authentication` for Git operations to enhance Security, with `Passwords Officially Deprecated for API use on August 13, 2021`.
  <br>
  
  - **Features:**
    - **`API Authentication:`** PATs allow developers to access a platform's API Programmatically.
    - **`Git Operations:`** Used to Authenticate Git Operations (e.g. git clone, git push, git pull) instead of passwords.
    - **`Tool Access:`** Enables External Tools (e.g., GitHub CLI, GitHub Desktop) to Authenticate Securely.
    - **`Scoped Access:`** Provides Control over which Resources can be Accessed.
  <br>
  
  - **Advantages Over Password-Authentication:**
    - **`Enhanced Security:`** **PATs are Specific to Certain Tasks and cannot be used to Log In to the Web Interface**, reducing the Risk of Full Account Compromise. They can be Encrypted and Stored Securely, Avoiding Exposure of Actual Passwords.
    - **`Fine-Grained Permissions:`** **PATs allow you to grant only the Necessary Permissions, such as Read-Only or Specific Repository Access**, unlike Passwords which provide Full Access.
    - **`Scoped Usage:`** **You can Limit PATs to Specific Actions**, such as accessing APIs, workflows, or repository management, while passwords have no such scoping capabilities.
    - **`Expiration and Control:`** **PATs can be Configured to Expire automatically after a Set Period**, improving Security by Limiting their Validity.
    - **`Ease of Revocation:`** **Individual PATs can be Revoked without affecting your Main Account or Other Access Methods.** Changing a Password disrupts all Tools and Sessions using it.

  - **GitHub offers Two Types of Personal-Access-Tokens:**
    - [**`Classic Personal-Access-Tokens`**](#classic-personal-access-tokens)
    - [**`Fine Grained Personal-Access-Tokens`**](#fine-grained-personal-access-tokens)
<br>

### Classic Personal-Access-Tokens:
  - Classic Tokens provide `Account-Wide Access`.
  - Classic Tokens offer `Broad, Predefined scopes with Limited Granularity`.
  - Classic Tokens `Cannot Limit Access to Specific Repositories`.
  - Classic Tokens are `Less Secure` due to their Broad Access.
<br>

### Fine Grained Personal-Access-Tokens:
  - Fine-Grained Tokens provide `Repository-Specific Access`.
  - Fine-grained Tokens allow `Precise Control over Permissions at the Repository and Action Level`.
  - Fine-grained Tokens are `More Secure` with Tailored Access to Resources.
  - `Permissions are Easier to Audit and Adjust` using Fine-Grained Tokens as compared to Classic Tokens.

## Using Personal-Access-Tokens (PAT) for Authentication in the Git_CLI
  - To Store and Use a Personal-Access-Token (PAT) in the Git CLI, you can utilize [`Git-Credential-Manager (GCM) or Git's Credential-Helper`](#) for Secure Management and Authentication.
